Practical Application Assignment 11.1 - Used Cars Dataset Analysis

Comments:
- Years of use is the most important variable that impacts on a vehicle's price
- The transmission type, 4wd drive and odometer measures have an important contribution to the vehicle price.
- It is important to notice that years of use have an inverse relationship to price, it means that as years of use increase price decrease
- It is curious that years of use if vehicle is 4wd does not impact negatively on price. 4wd drive helps to increase price
